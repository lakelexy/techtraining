Git is a version control systems that serve as the backbone of modern software development, enabling developers to track and manage changes to their code effectively.

Git operates on the principle of creating snapshots or "commits" of your code at different stages, allowing you to revert to previous versions if needed. It introduces the concept of a repository, which acts as a central storehouse for all your project's files and their revision history. 

Git is a free and open-source version control system, originally created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. Unlike older centralized version control systems such as SVN and CVS, Git is distributed: every developer has the full history of their code repository locally.

Git also has excellent support for branching, merging, and rewriting repository history, which has led to many innovative and powerful workflows and tools. Pull requests are one such popular tool that allows teams to collaborate on Git branches and efficiently review each other's code. Git is the most widely used version control system in theworld today and is considered the modern standard for software development.
